# Welcome to my Portfolio!

This website is divided into sections for the following: about, portfolio, experience, education. The project was built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JS. I also employed a few JS libraries, such as Particles.js and animate-on-scroll. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions!

        <h1>Junior Year</h1>
        <h6>My Junior year was a pivot as I became a choreographer for the dance teams I was a part of. I continued as choreographer for Homecoming Boy's Dance and became choreographer for Lynbrook Jalwa. I had 33 dancers to teach for Homecoming with my two choreographer partners and it was a challenge for me to spend time on dance as I had a stressful Junior year. I had to order costumes for the dancers, which is an extremely large order and led to many complications, such as companies cancelling the order.<br><br>As a Jalwa choreographer, I spent a lot of time with my three partners to determine the team of 16 boys and girls and figure out the costumes. I had shipped the costumes from India for our performance at Silslay in February, the event I was hosting as an officer of American-Indian Student Association. I had a lot of fun choreographing for Jalwa because many of the dancers the previous year were seniors and since they graduated, I worked with almost an entirely new group of dancers and it was a challenge to work with a small group of people who do not know each other that well. Fortunately, by the end of the dance season, we became very close as a family.</h6>

      <h1>Sophomore Year</h1>
      <h6>In my sophomore year, I confidently took the role of homecoming choreographer and worked hard to earn it. I worked as dance manager and choreographer by ordering all the costumes and talking to the dancers as well as teaching them my choreography. This was the first time I taught a large group of my peers as I had two partner choreographers and we had to teach 24 others. This was a huge challenge for me as I had to be assertive when it came to practices and ensure that people are focusing on the dance and actively learning the choreography. <br><br>In the spring, I decided to join my first two Bollywood dance teams, Lynbrook Jalwa and Lakshya. Lynbrook Jalwa became like a family and I really enjoyed dancing at Lynbrook's annual Indian showcase, Silsilay. I also participated in the Lynbrook Lakshya team which performed at the Indian Community Center in April and Monta Vista for their show. I learned a lot, having the opportunity to perform more and be accustomed to different environments. This was also when I expanded my dance diversity as I discovered different styles of dance from my Bollywood choreographers.</h6>

    <h1>Freshman Year</h1>
    <h6>My passion for dance blossomed in my freshman year as I took the impossible task of joining the small group of boys without having any dance experience. It turned out that I was charged with choreographing for the dance and I spent hours learning from online tutorials and videos. Despite my fears, it was an amazing opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone and experience an activity that grew to define who I am. From dance I learned leadership skills, stage presence, and teamwork as I continued to choreograph dances into my remaining years of high school.</h6>

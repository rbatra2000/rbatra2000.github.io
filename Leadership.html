        <h6>Becoming Vice President has been a challenge for me to get accustomed to, but I am working with an amazing group of individuals who have been teaching more and more about how to be a good leader for my class. My responsibilities include reaching out to the class for feedback regarding the officer team, planning events such as Prom, and making the class's senior year as profitable as possible. I recently attended a leadership conference with leaders from many different schools in the area and I learned how to be more outspoken and reach out to people, rather than waiting for them. I have already worked to make the class's senior year the best it can be by planning the Senior Prom venue and Homecoming skits, dances, and decorations. I am currently building different structures for decorations and choreographing for the men's dance. More information will be available soon as the school year starts!</h6>

        <h6>Prior to becoming a class officer, I had experience as a leader in dance and a few clubs on the Lynbrook campus. During my Junior year, I was Public Relations Officer of American-Indo Student Association (AISA) and Secretary/Co-founder of Lynbrook's JUMP dance club. AISA promotes Asian-Indian culture on campus, whereas JUMP promotes stress-relief and individuality through dance. From these experiences, I was able to build the confidence to run for class office and gain exposure to leadership responsibilities. My experiences as a choreographer for multiple dance teams gave me the opportunity to meet new people and present myself as an approachable leader. Below is a video edited by myself with information about JUMP Dance Club with many of my own videos and pictures.</h6>

              <h3>
                I am currently a UC Berkeley Freshman studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.
              </h3>
              <p>
                Hi! My name is Ritik and I come from the heart of the Bay Area: San Jose, California. Having grown up in the Silicon Valley, I have always been passionate about technology positively impacting the lives of people around the world.
                <br><br>
                Last summer, I worked as a Junior Instructor at BlueStamp Engineering to not only teach high school students electrical, mechanical, and software engineering but also improve my engineering-related problem solving skills. Apart from my interests in programming and product development, I love dancing, playing the guitar/alto saxophone, and writing fictional stories.
                <br><br>
                I am currently searching for an internship related to front-end software development/product development for the upcoming summer in 2019, so if you are interested in me as an applicant, please feel free to reach out to me through email or my contact form at the bottom of the page.

                            a patient's cancer to provide the best possible recommendation for
                            a cure. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the company fell bankrupt
                            and our team decided to pivot by improving the decade-old recruitment
                            process for Venture as an organization to remove bias and diversify
                            the new member pool.

                        Semester 1: Driver, Inc./Internal Project
                      </h3>
                      <p>
                        As a freshman at UC Berkeley, I was thrilled to hear about the
                        opportunities presented to me by the hundreds of organizations
                        around campus. After hearing about consulting, I was immediately
                        captured by the work done by consulting clubs on campus and to
                        align that with my interest in entrepreneurship, I decided to
                        apply to Venture Strategy Solutions.
                        <br><br>
                        After a rigorous application process, I was fortunate to be among
                        7 new members of an initial 200 applicant pool. I immediately dove
                        into the work by joining the team consulting for Driver, Inc. Driver
                        was a start-up that aggregated all clinical trials and cancer treatments
                        to recommend the best possible process for cancer patients based on data analysis.
                        <br><br>
                        Driver wanted us to spend the first half being external consultants:
                        learning about the market of healthcare technology and constructing a
                        Chinese penetration strategy for their recent product launch. My primary
                        task was to analyze the competitors of Driver and note what made those
                        companies succeed (especially in China).
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately due to the volatile start-up culture, Driver went bankrupt half
                        way through the semester, leaving my team without a project. We decided to embark
                        upon a Venture internal project to improve its branding and recruitment process.
                        Venture has been maintaining the same website for the past few decades and unfortunately,
                        it is out-of-date and leading to many unwanted biases within the new member pool.
                        <br><br>
                        In addition, I am working with a friend/co-consultant to completely redesign and
                        reinvent Venture's website to attract more clients as well as
                        applicants for the organization.

                    “I’m not sure I can do this,” I thought, panicked by the idea of
                    dancing with more than 1,000 of my fellow students in the audience.
                    I had never performed in front of anyone prior to this moment, much
                    less choreographed anything. Was I was about to make a fool of myself?
                    <br><br>
                    My heart pounded, and my leg muscles shook as I forced myself onstage.
                    Then, the familiar music began, and I surrendered myself to the rhythms.
                    My fears drained away as I focused on remembering the moves I had designed for myself.
                    At first I felt clumsy following the beat, but the audience helped me relax by
                    clapping in time. I was thrilled to find myself entertaining people and smiled broadly
                    as my hands interpreted the lyrics and my feet snapped to position.
                    <br><br>
                    My enthusiasm grew with the positive response, and when the two minutes
                    and thirty seconds had passed and I ran off the stage to a roar of approval,
                    I thought, “I wish the song could have gone on longer.” Little did I know
                    that this freshman dance, part of my new school’s homecoming celebration,
                    was the birth of an obsession. I wanted to dance for the rest of my life.
                    <br><br>
                    In fact, dance has become my life; I currently dance on a competitive
                    Bollywood, Hip-Hop, and Bhangra team at UC Berkeley called Zahanat and
                    continue to dance at sports rallies and entertain at parties. I had continued
                    choreographing for Homecoming as a sophomore, junior, and senior in high school
                    and love to teach peers who do not have any dance experience. I hope to continue
                    choreographing in the future!
                    <br><br>
                    Dance has changed who I am. From my beginnings as a shy freshman lacking
                    confidence, I have grown into a leader with an outgoing personality and the ability
                    to communicate with others clearly and naturally. Dancing on different teams has
                    introduced me to people from other schools and diverse backgrounds. But dance has
                    played an even more personal role in my life.
                    <br><br>
                    As I found my academic and extracurricular course load increasing in
                    high school, my stress often reached unhealthy levels. This high-demand
                    environment left me overwhelmed and depressed, but I was able to find the route
                    to lowering my stress through dance. As soon as I started dancing or choreographing,
                    my stress levels fell, and I was able to calm myself and perform up to my potential.
                    After enjoying dance as a stress reliever, I wondered if I could get others more
                    involved in dance for the same reason.
                    <br><br>
                    As a result, I founded JUMP, a new club that promotes creativity and expression
                    to relieve student stress levels through dance. After gaining school administration
                    approval, JUMP quickly became part of my high school’s culture. We invited alumni
                    and current students to teach their dance pieces to many different students on
                    campus, and we participated in Lynbrook’s annual stress relief week by inviting
                    dancers from Stanford, Columbia, Berkeley, and more prestigious universities
                    to teach choreography. Being part of JUMP has been a stress-reducer for me as
                    well as the majority of the club’s members as we learn from each other in a
                    non-judgmental environment.
                    <br><br>
                    But performing on stage remains my favorite part of dancing. The moment
                    before I enter the stage has always been the most exciting for me, whether
                    I’m a performer who relishes dancing or a choreographer who loves to see other
                    dancers grow and expand their styles. Although I suffer from stage fright
                    immediately before a performance begins, my passion for dance makes me forget
                    my fears and perform at my very best. Now when I see doubt and anxiety on the
                    face of my dancers, I recall my own journey and tell them with confidence,
                    “I did it, and I know you can, too.”

                    Ever since I was small, music has been an important part of my life.
                    I started learning to play the guitar at the age of 5 and I fell in
                    love with music. I learned the basics for reading music and started to
                    train my ears musically.
                    <br><br>
                    When I turned 9, I decided to pivot to alto saxophone with a focus
                    on classical and jazz music. I first joined the school band and
                    continued until high school, when I decided that I prefered being
                    a soloist over a member of a band.
                    <br><br>
                    I continued taking private lessons for saxophone and performing as
                    a soloist. Eventually, I decided to put my skills to the test through
                    the Music Teachers' Association of California's music study program.
                    With my years of experience, I decided to jump to level 6 and take the exam.
                    <br><br>
                    The Level 6 Exam is comprised of 3 parts: Technical Evaluation,
                    Virtuosity Check, and Music Theory Exam. After weeks of prepration,
                    I received my Certificate of Merit from MTAC. This certificate gave
                    me the validation to perform in public and I started being more
                    comfortable performing for friends and family.
                    <br><br>
                    After high school ended, I quit private lessons, but continue
                    practicing guitar/alto saxophone on my own as a hobby. Although
                    I may not practice every day, the disciplinary/creative skills
                    that I gained made me into who I am today.

                  <p style="margin-left: 75px;margin-right: 75px;">
                    I had volunteered in a variety of school organizations over
                    my first three years, but as I neared my penultimate year of
                    high school, I felt something was missing: a classic leadership
                    role. So, I decided to run for the position of class Vice President.
                    Fortunately, I was elected by my peers, and served as senior class officer.
                    <br><br>
                    Because I was the newest vice president on the officer team,
                    I initially held my opinions in abeyance, believing that the
                    other officers knew more than me. But showing deference to these
                    experienced officers did not serve me well, as I was not taking
                    the responsibility to represent my class assertively. I began
                    voicing my opinions and assuming the leadership role that I aspired to fill.
                    <br><br>
                    One example of my newfound assertiveness came during a homecoming
                    decoration meeting a few days before our performance. While rapidly
                    creating posters, one of my peers was drawing on white paper to create
                    a design with "2018 Love," but I noticed that the colors of the letters
                    were bland, and the lines were uneven.
                    <br><br>
                    I approached her and said, "Hi! Thank you for spending so much time
                    on these posters, but I noticed that there is not enough color on
                    this one. Can I help you with the next one so we can make it even better?"
                    <br><br>
                    At first, she was offended by my criticism, but after working
                    together on the next poster she agreed that the extra work was
                    necessary: "Thanks for helping, she said. I'll make the next one even better!"
                    <br><br>
                    This experience taught me that a leader's responsibility is to be
                    a positive influence by ensuring that standards are met while still
                    showing respect for others' ideas and abilities. I realize that my
                    judgments may not always be popular, but that it is important for me
                    to voice them all the same. As I participated in discussions related
                    to school and class business, I made certain to say what I think honestly
                    and immediately. This lesson in leadership will be greatly beneficial to
                    both myself and others for many years to come.
                    <br><br>
                    As class vice president, I was charged with the task of organizing
                    senior prom, constructing a new senior activity, foster community
                    within the class through rallies and Homecoming, and more.

                    The candle flame bursts to life as my parents help me steady
                    the sparkler. I stare with joy as colors light up the night;
                    this annually recurring memory is what I treasure most from my
                    childhood. Diwali, the Indian festival of lights, has always
                    influenced me to embrace my Indian culture.
                    <br><br>
                    My parents were born in India and immigrated to the United
                    States, searching for new opportunities. Although they were
                    far from their birthplace, they still incorporated Indian culture
                    into my childhood. From speaking in Hindi to driving me to Hindu
                    temples, my parents taught me to appreciate India’s festivities and
                    history and instilled in me a strong cultural identity.
                    <br><br>
                    To combine my dance passion with my cultural pride, I joined my
                    high school’s Bollywood team. Attending my dance performances
                    around the Bay Area introduced my family and me to the active
                    Indian community in our district.
                    <br><br>
                    To continue building bridges within the community, I joined the
                    American-Indo Student Association (AISA) club as a high school
                    sophomore. I was delighted to discover that the club gives back
                    to the Indian community by fundraising to improve rural Indian
                    communities. I achieved President as a senior and changed the
                    club dynamic by expanding to be a larger part of the local
                    community by hosting more cultural events, such as a traditional Garba Raas.
                    <br><br>
                    I am grateful to have had opportunities to explore my heritage
                    and look forward to learning about other cultures throughout my
                    life. At Berkeley, by being associated with a Bollywood team, I
                    am well-connected to the Indian community and am able to perform
                    at festivals, such as Diwali here.

                      Let's attack this problem: College students have to make many
                      daily transactions with other students and have no organized
                      manner of doing so. This results in unnecessary complications
                      and general inefficiency.
                      <br><br>
                      As a solution, we have created a text-based bot that processes individual and group texts to understand user intents to transfer money.
                      This bot uses Nexmo and Venmo APIs to easily charge other users'
                      Venmo accounts when the natural language processor picks up specific
                      key words in a group text.

                      SmartShoe is an enhanced running shoe that has sensors to
                      revolutionize a runner's experience. With an embedded heart
                      rate monitor, GPS, Arduino Lilypad, and Bluetooth module,
                      the shoe can communicate with smartphones to help runners
                      train on their own based on the data given and with the
                      vibrational motors and SD card writer, they can go on runs
                      without having their smartphone with them and still navigate
                      and retain the data from the run.

                      ICON is a crowd-sourced fashion app that allows users to find out
                      what someone else is wearing and local fashion trends. ICON lets
                      you build a virtual closet by taking pictures of your physical clothing.
                      Each day the user selects the articles of the clothings that make up
                      their outfit of the day. While walking around, if the user sees someone
                      wearing something interesting they can open the app and collect nearby
                      outfits from other users with in 10 meters.

                      JavaRun is a 2D infinite runner created from scratch using Java.
                      By creating the game on Java and releasing it as a .jar file, the
                      game is compatible with Apple and Windows computers. To create this
                      game, I had to apply all my OOP programming knowledge to create a
                      well-designed game with structure as you can see on slide 8 above.
